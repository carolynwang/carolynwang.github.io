									<h4>the slightly longer version:</h4>
									<p>after graduating [virtually] from uc berkeley, i started working as a software development engineer as amazon web services. i am on the sagemaker
										data parallel team, developing <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel.html">sagemaker's distributed data parallelism
										library</a> for deep learning training jobs on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html">sagemaker</a>. prior to this,
										i had interned in one of the sister deep engines teams and had designed and implemented the initial release of
										<a href="https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/aws/sagemaker">sagemaker components for kubeflow pipelines</a>. i also
										interned at mongodb for a summer, designing and implementing support for faceting for
										<a href="https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/">Atlas Search</a>.</p>
									<p>on the photography side, i started really getting into portrait photography during my senior year of high school. at that point, i had been the
										family photographer for many years (resulting in a lack of photos of me on vacations, but that's besides the point). i started discovering
										photography youtube channels, inspiring me learn to use the family dslr to its full potential. i then learned all about post-processing photos
										and have gradually been developing my editing style. what you see in my portfolio now is the result of five years of fiddling with the lightroom
										sliders, and it is still evolving. i mainly take photos of people, doing several grad photo sessions each grad season.</p>
									<p>in addition to ~coding~ and photography, i also spend a good chunk of time drawing, cooking, baking, trying to play guitar, watching american
										television and korean and chinese dramas, and reading up on whatever topic i've taken an interest in at the time, which could be anything from
										finance to the allusions to christian theology in twenty one pilots music. and this is the exact reason why i say i'm all over the place.
										apparently, i'm incapable of choosing one thing and getting really good at it; i have a tendency to try to do anything i find interesting.
										i don't know if that's a good or a bad thing... perhaps it doesn't have to be either, it just is a thing.</p>
									<p>anyway, that's all i have to say for now. if you want to chat about anything, just drop a message in my contact page!</p>
