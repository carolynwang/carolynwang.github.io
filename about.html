									<h4>The slightly longer version:</h4>
									<p>After graduating [virtually] from UC Berkeley, I started working as a software development engineer as Amazon Web Services on the SageMaker
										data parallel team, developing <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel.html">SageMaker's distributed data parallelism
										library</a> for deep learning training jobs on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html">SageMaker</a>. Prior to this,
										I had interned in one of the sister deep engines teams, during which I designed and implemented the initial release of
										<a href="https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/aws/sagemaker">SageMaker components for Kubeflow Pipelines</a>. I also
										interned at MongoDB for a summer, designing and implementing support for faceting for
										<a href="https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/">Atlas Search</a>.</p>
									<p>On the photography side, I started really getting into portrait photography in 2016 during my senior year of high school after discovering several
										photography YouTube channels, inspiring me learn to use the family DSLR to its full potential. I then learned all about post-processing photos (aka
										Lightroom magic) and have gradually been developing my editing style since. What you see in my portfolio now is the result of many years of fiddling
										with the Lightroom sliders.</p>
									<p>In addition to ~coding~ and photography, I also spend a good chunk of time drawing, cooking, baking, trying to play guitar, watching American
										television and Korean and Chinese dramas, and reading up on whatever topic I've taken an interest in at the time, which could be anything from
										finance to the allusions to Christian theology in twenty one pilots music. Apparently, I have a tendency to try to do anything I find interesting.</p>
									<p>Anyway, that's all I have to say for now. If you want to chat about anything, just <a href="contact.html">drop me a message!</a></p>
